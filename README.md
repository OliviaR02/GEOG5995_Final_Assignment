This repository includes all the code necessary for the analysis of the GEOG5995_Final_Assignment. 

## Background 

The general consensus among both the public and policymakers revolves around the presumption of a direct association between the extent of deprivation in an area and the quality of its infrastructure, such as the condition of roads and pavements. This report delves into Scottish open source data to examine the presence of any correlation between these factors. The objective is to ascertain whether policymakers should prioritize initiatives aimed at enhancing the day-to-day living standards of residents in Glasgow's more disadvantaged areas.

## Data Sources Overview

### 1. Scottish Street Data 
The Scottish street data used in this project originates from the Urban Big Data Centre. This dataset includes comprehensive reports from the Glasgow area, detailing information about pavements, footpaths, and issues related to potholes.

### 2. Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 
The second dataset utilized in this project comprises the Scotland-wide Index of Multiple Deprivation. This data was collected in 2020 and sourced from the Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC) database.

## Aims

The aim of this report is to show the analysis of open source data sets, to obtain whether or not there is a relationship between the variables. This is achieved through extensive cleaning of both datasets and production of spatial and non-spatial visualisations.
